Background Information:</font></b>
<p>I received my B.S. in physics from the <a href="http://www.uni.edu">University of Northern Iowa</a>.
As an undergraduate I worked on two research projects. One, working with Dr. Michael Roth on 
<i>``Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Hexane on Graphite at Various Coverages''</i> and another with
Dr. Fred Behroozi which involved automating laser interferometry measurements of surface tension using LabView.
<p>I received my Ph.D. in Physics in 2014 at the <a href="https://physics.missouri.edu">University
of Missouri</a>, in Columbia, MO, working with <a href="http://faculty.missouri.edu/~wexlerc/"> Dr. Carlos Wexler
</a>. My dissertation was on <i>``Sorbate Structure and Dynamics Effect on Sorption Properties: Theory and Experiment,''</i>&nbsp; where I used
molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and neutron scattering to study hydrogen adsorption on carbon-based adsorbents.
