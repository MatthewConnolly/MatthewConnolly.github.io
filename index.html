						<br>Believe it or not, one of the most difficult aspects of being a physicist is figuring out how to answer the inevitable question
						<font color=#1d2982> "So, what exactly is it that you <i>do</i>?" </font> After all, there aren't many of us out there, and it's not as though 
						you can run down to the local Mom n' Pop Physics store to have a look at how the physics is made. Sure, there are
						some popular TV shows out there that try to depict physicists, but I would argue that these depictions are entirely off-base. We aren't nearly as
						nerdy as depicted in some aspects, and in other aspects we're 100x as nerdy as portrayed.

					<p>
						When people ask me what it is that I do, I usually say "I do science", and hope it ends there. Around 20% of the time,
						a bit more around Boulder, the asker will let me know their theory of what the 4th dimension is or how time is circular. 
						Another 40% the only response will be to share with me how bad the person was at math in high school. The remaining 40% 
						of the time that answer isn't satisfying to the inquirer, so I go on to explain that I study hydrogen embrittlement of 
						pipeline steel. I'll give the elevator pitch about how we want to use the same pipes that are in the ground for natural
						gas service, but these steel pipes become brittle in the presence of hydrogen and it's not entirely clear why, and if we can't
						figure out the "why", then we have no idea how to fix it. Okay, so I "study" hydrogen embrittlement by doing "science", but what
						exactly does that entail? In high school and college we've all studied for tests and it usually involved working through problems
						or making note cards to help memorize information. But, what happens when the information doesn't currently exist? That's the task
						a physicist is charged with: producing, rather than consuming, knowledge. At the end of the day, this amounts to performing an experiment,
						reporting the results, and coming to conclusions based on those results in the context of existing literature. Sounds pretty 
						straight-forward, but in reality going from an idea for an experiment to publishing those results requires hundreds of in-between steps:
						I need to develop a model (in a Mathematica or Matlab notebook) or series of back-of-the-envelope calculations to get a sense of whether 
						the experiment actually has a chance to work; I need to build experimental equipment like a gas manifold or pressure chamber; I need to take
						the raw data and put it in a form that can be understood (often using python or c++ code); and I need to read lots and lots to see
						how the results jive with the experiments that have been done by other groups. These are the day-to-day tasks that hide behind my
						description of my job as "doing science".
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I started this website to give myself an online CV and, in the process, to learn some HTML/CSS/web design. It took me a while to think about
						exactly what I wanted to do with this, but I think I've finally figured it out. Because I'm expecting viewership of this site to be essentially limited
						to my wife, mostly this will be a sort of journal for myself to keep track of what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis.  But, if you aren't my wife and happen to be
						looking, then what I am hoping to offer is a look at the behind the scenes at your local Physics Store and give an idea of how the physics is made.

Research Interests:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>

<p>
My current research focus is on the study of hydrogen embrittlement and hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth in pipeline steels. 
In an effort to elucidate hydrogen-assisted damage mechanisms, I am using synchrotron x-ray and neutron scattering techniques to 
measure the stress/strain field, dislocation density, material phase changes, phonon spectra, and hydrogen concentration near fatigue crack tips.  
I am also interested in other corrosive environments (e.g. radiation, CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen isotopes) as well as fracture resistant materials 
(e.g. high entropy alloys).  For physical parameters which are difficult to determine experimentally (e.g. H<sub>2</sub> diffusion rates), I use <i>ab initio</i>, 
Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations of the physical systems. I am currently involved in developing a neutron Transmission Bragg Edge Strain 
Tensor Tomography (TBESTT) measurement technique, which will provide full 3D strain tensor fields in structural materials. I am interested in developing 
novel experimental apparatus (e.g. pressure vessels, load frames, temperature control) for <i>in situ</i> strain measurements. <br>&nbsp;

Background Information:</font></b>
<p>I received my B.S. in physics from the <a href="http://www.uni.edu">University of Northern Iowa</a>.
As an undergraduate I worked on two research projects. One, working with Dr. Michael Roth on 
<i>``Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Hexane on Graphite at Various Coverages''</i> and another with
Dr. Fred Behroozi which involved automating laser interferometry measurements of surface tension using LabView.
<br><br>
<p>I received my Ph.D. in Physics in 2014 at the <a href="https://physics.missouri.edu">University
of Missouri</a>, in Columbia, MO, working with <a href="http://faculty.missouri.edu/~wexlerc/"> Dr. Carlos Wexler
</a>. My dissertation was on <i>``Sorbate Structure and Dynamics Effect on Sorption Properties: Theory and Experiment,''</i>&nbsp; where I used
molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and neutron scattering to study hydrogen adsorption on carbon-based adsorbents.
