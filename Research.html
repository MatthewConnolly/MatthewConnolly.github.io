My current research focus is on the study of hydrogen embrittlement and hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth in pipeline steels. 
In an effort to elucidate hydrogen-assisted damage mechanisms, I am using synchrotron x-ray and neutron scattering techniques to 
measure the stress/strain field, dislocation density, material phase changes, phonon spectra, and hydrogen concentration near fatigue crack tips.  
I am also interested in other corrosive environments (e.g. radiation, CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen isotopes) as well as fracture resistant materials 
(e.g. high entropy alloys).  For physical parameters which are difficult to determine experimentally (e.g. H<sub>2</sub> diffusion rates), I use <i>ab initio</i>, 
Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations of the physical systems. I am currently involved in developing a neutron Transmission Bragg Edge Strain 
Tensor Tomography (TBESTT) measurement technique, which will provide full 3D strain tensor fields in structural materials. I am interested in developing 
novel experimental apparatus (e.g. pressure vessels, load frames, temperature control) for <i>in situ</i> strain measurements. <br>&nbsp;
